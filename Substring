You are given a group of sentences. A sentence consists of many words . A word in turn may contain many substrings .A word may or maynot be a  meaningful English word.
For e.g. lant3rn,lanturn , _ln_trn_ and lantern  are  words for us .
We define our substring to be     
    a) a part of the  word.
    b)it must be preceded and succeeded by letters  or an underscore.
For each sentence you need to find a specific substring "S" such that S occurs in between some word, not at the end or start.
For e.g. In the word "WORD" ," OR " is a valid substring and " RD " and " WO " are not .
Given N sentences ,and a substring S for each sentence ,we have to find no of valid occurrence of S as substring in the respective sentence.
